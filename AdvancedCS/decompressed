Assignment 

Read and take notes on Eric Foner, The American Revolution (Links to an external site.).
Read and take notes on this background piece (Links to an external site.) about the Boston Massacre.
Please enter two questions that you have about these readings onto our Canvas Chat by 10:00 pm the night before our first class of this week.
Class/Zoom:

Discuss Canvas Chat questions.
In breakout groups make a timeline of period 1763-1776 focusing on events that led to Revolution (and ask questions about any events on timeline that you do not fully understand).
Report back to entire group to make an agreed upon timeline of important events between 1763 and 1776 (use whiteboard).
Look at Paul Revere’s print (Links to an external site.) depicting the Boston Massacre.
Find three things in Revere’s print that seem consistent with what you read for the assignment and three things that seem inconsistent (or factually suspect)?
For another 1770s depiction of the Massacre (and to see some possible eighteenth century plagiarism), check out this (Links to an external site.).
During the Massacre, the British shot Crispus Attucks, a Framingham native and former slave who was of African-American and Native-American descent. However, neither the Pelham or Revere print show someone of mixed Native-American or African-American descent. The earliest depiction of Crispus Attucks as a person of color is in an 1855 drawing (Links to an external site.) by William L. Champney. Like Revere, Champney was from Boston. Look at Revere's engraving (Links to an external site.) and Champney’s artwork. Why didn’t Revere portray Attucks as a person of color in the 1770s but Champney did so in the 1850s?
